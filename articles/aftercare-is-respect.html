  <h1>Aftercare is respect</h1>
  <p><em>What happens after intimacy matters as much as what happens during</em></p>

  <p>Aftercare is not a bonus feature. It’s not something you add on if you remember. It’s not reserved for kink, therapy language, or people who think a lot about feelings.</p>
  <p>Aftercare is simply what respect looks like when bodies have just shared something physical.</p>

  <h2>What aftercare actually means</h2>
  <p>Aftercare is the period of attention, adjustment, and presence that follows intimacy. It’s how bodies recalibrate. It’s how nervous systems come back to baseline. It’s how people feel held instead of abruptly dismissed.</p>
  <p>This can take minutes or longer. There’s no stopwatch.</p>

  <h2>Why bodies need it</h2>
  <p>Intimacy changes things. Hormones shift. Heart rates drop. Muscles relax. Sensitivity increases. For some people, emotions surface quietly. For others, there’s just a need for stillness.</p>
  <p>When aftercare is skipped, the body doesn’t feel wrong — it feels unfinished.</p>

  <h2>What aftercare looks like (in real life)</h2>
  <p>Aftercare does not need to be theatrical. It does need to be intentional.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>staying physically close for a moment</li>
    <li>gentle touch without expectation</li>
    <li>water, warmth, or a blanket</li>
    <li>checking in without interrogating</li>
    <li>letting silence exist</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s not about saying the perfect thing. It’s about not rushing the exit.</p>

  <h2>Aftercare and hygiene</h2>
  <p>Care after intimacy is practical too.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hydration</li>
    <li>gentle external cleaning</li>
    <li>changing sheets or towels if needed</li>
    <li>comfort-focused clothing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>None of this is performative. It’s maintenance — the same way you’d treat any system after use.</p>

  <h2>Communication counts</h2>
  <p>Aftercare is a good time for light honesty, not postmortems.</p>
  <p>A simple “How are you feeling?” goes further than analysis. A quiet “You okay?” can be grounding. You don’t need to resolve anything. You just need to stay present.</p>

  <h2>If you’re not sure what someone needs</h2>
  <p>Ask. Not dramatically — casually.</p>
  <p>“Do you want to stay close or have space?”<br>“Water?”<br>“Can I get you anything?”</p>
  <p>These questions signal safety, not insecurity.</p>

  <h2>The point</h2>
  <p><strong>Aftercare is not about prolonging intimacy. It’s about closing it well.</strong></p>
  <p>How something ends is often what people remember most. When aftercare is present, bodies feel respected, not used. Systems reset cleanly.</p>
  <p>That’s not romance. That’s competence.</p>
