    <h3>Gentle, unscented external cleanser</h3>
    <p>
      A fragrance-free cleanser designed for skin — not deodorizing,
      not numbing, and not trying to “correct” anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chosen because it cleans comfortably, stays external,
      and doesn’t create irritation loops.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Not for internal use. Not marketed as freshness.
    </p>

    <h3>Soft reusable cloths</h3>
    <p>
      Plain cotton or bamboo cloths that let you control pressure,
      moisture, and friction — without chemicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chosen because hands and water do most of the work.
      Cloths just help with gentleness.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Not scented wipes. Not disposable irritation.

    <h3>Simple, neutral moisturizer</h3>
    <p>
      A basic moisturizer for external skin comfort after washing
      or friction — no actives, no fragrance, no sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chosen because calm skin heals faster than “treated” skin.
